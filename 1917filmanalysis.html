He is known for doing long one shot movies. Where the editing makes the film look as one long take. 1917&rsquo;s cinematography is no different; the film was filmed as one shot. 1917 is a film based around WWI on the western front in the northern part of France during operation Alberich. 1917 carries many ideas throughout it&rsquo;s runtime. Such as bravery, warfare and loss. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film starts with Lance corporal Blake and schofield napping under a tree when a sergeant wakes up lance corporal Blake and informs him that the general needs to see him and to pick a soldier to go with him. Not knowing what he was able to be selected for, Lance Corporal Blake asks Lance Corporal Schofield to go with him. &nbsp;They met with General Erinmore who gives them that the phone line to the devonshire regiment has been cut and gives them the task of relaying a message over to colonel Mackenzie. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As both Schofield and Blake are exiting the trenches we get a glimpse of how on edge and exhausted the soldiers are from war. With Blake almost getting into a fight with another soldier just for bumping into him. As they are leaving the trenches they get sent off by a drunk lieutant who &ldquo;blesses&rdquo; them with the alcohol he is drinking and here is where we first explore one of the main Ideas of the film about warfare. The Sergeant very cynically tells both the boys that if they die to please chuck the flare gun over the trenches as he hates losing them. The boys exit the trenches and they pass through the no man&#39;s land which is muddy and bombarded. The scene shows giant craters and bodies stacked on top of one another. As both schofield and blake are moving through barbed wire schofield cuts his hand then schofield accidentally puts his hand inside a corpse. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of bravery is portrayed in this next scene when both Schofield and Blake are exploring the german trench and a rat triggers a tripwire which sets off a trap. Schofield gets buried under some rubble and instead of fleeing Blake quickly hops into action and begins to dig him up. The dust had gotten into Schofields eyes so Blake had to lead him through the caves. Both boys manage to get out and escape being caved in and Blake is willing to risk his own life to rescue his fellow man&rsquo;s <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boys make it to a farmhouse where we start to see a bit into Blake&#39;s past before the war. He makes a comment about how the trees that are chopped down are cherry trees. He explains that they come in all different varieties and that it&rsquo;s too early to tell what type of variety that is right now. Schofield askes Blake how he would know that and he explains that his mother has a cherry tree orchard back at home. They find a cow in the barnyard and schofield gathers some milk. Then above the farm there&rsquo;s a dogfight between a german fighter and an english fighter. The german fighter gets shot down and both Schofiled and Blake help the fighter out of the burning plane.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;The idea of loss is portrayed as the german fighter stabs Blake while he was fetching water. Schofield shoots down the germans and immediately attempts to aid Blake but Blake dies in his arms. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Schofield is trying to mourn the loss of a friend, allied soldiers show up and attempt to assist Schofield in carrying blakes body. Schofield temporally joins the soldiers on their way to the frontlines. When he is about to depart from them the captain tells Schofield to make sure there are witnesses when he tells them about the orders to call off the attack as &ldquo;some men are just in it for the fight&rdquo; which adds to the idea of warfare. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Schofield is crossing the bridge over to the french city he starts getting shot at by a french sniper. The cinematography of this scene is very impressive as the camera moves over the pond from one end to the other. Schofield hits the sniper and he heads up to the tower that schofield was on and when he is about to shoot the soldier he gets shot in the head. Schofield is knocked out and wakes up to a city that&rsquo;s on fire. Schofield continues his mission towards colonel mackenzie. He makes his way across a war-torn city then flares start to go off and you see shots ring around the schofield, he runs into a german soldier on patrol and finds shelter in a run-down basement. &nbsp;In this basement you see a woman and her child. There was a very clear language barrier between the two as the woman was tending to his wounds. We hear a cry in the background and we find out that the woman has a child with her. Schofield starts to offer up his rations and the milk he collected from the farm. This scene is very important because we later find out that Schofield has a wife and child of his own and you can see that this woman and her child reminds him of them. Seeing this woman and her child gives Schofield motivation to keep pushing further to deliver the message. &nbsp;Against the woman&rsquo;s advice Schofield leaves during daylight and is chased down by german infantry and jumps off a cliff into water. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schofield wakes up on the bank of the river shore and follows the sound of a singing voice. As schofield gets closer to the sound of the singing voice we start seeing the silhouettes of soldiers sitting down. No one acknowledges Schofields presence until after the song is finished. It wasn&rsquo;t until a couple of soldiers started talking to him that he realized that he had made it to the devonshire regiment. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">At this point Schofield is so exhausted from his mission that he can barely get a word out. When he finally does get a word out he finds out that they are in the process of sending out the first wave of soldiers. Schofield quickly gets up and starts running through the line looking for colonel mackenzie. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">He starts pushing through people asking sargents and other officers asking where colonel Mackenzie is. After reaching the front, Soldiers are preparing for the rush. There are a variety of different reactions. Some the lower level officers are shown yelling and preparing for the worst while others are just sitting there and doing nothing. An officer was even shown to be crying due to the stresses of war. At some point the whistle is blown for the first wave to advance, Schofield is unable to make it past the men to the officer&rsquo;s bunker so he runs to the top of the trenches to get there instead. This is very interesting because Schofield is running against artillery fire and tripping into other soldiers in the process. After doing some research about this scene in particular I found out that the Schofield falling wasn&rsquo;t intentional and that they let these mistakes become what made this scene so great. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Schofield finally makes it past the 300 yard dash to the officer&rsquo;s den and when attempting to get is stopped by two men guarding the entrance. He makes it past the two men and gets to colonel MacKenzie where he believes that he can still win this battle and that the germans are on the run. After reading the note Mackenzie reluctantly agrees to call off the attack and promptly tells Schofield to go away. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schofield, finally done with his mission is relieved and set out to find Blake&#39;s brother Lieutenant joseph. He is informed that lieutenant Joseph is in the casualty tent. Schofield makes his way over there and there are hundreds of injured men on cots. We see the victims of war here. After calling out the name of the lieutenant a few times Schofield finally gets to Joseph. Excited to hear that Schofield is from his brother&rsquo;s regiment Lieutenant Joseph immediately asks Schofield if he knows his brother and then Schofield starts telling him about what happened to his brother. &nbsp;Lieutenant dan is in tears as he comes to terms with the loss of his brother. Another scene that adds to the general idea of loss that is portrayed in this film. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie ends with Schofield making his way over to a tree and pulling out pictures of his wife and child. This scene is also very important because in the beginning he was leaning against a tree and this movie ends with him sitting at a tree. This was shown to represent that Schofield had come full circle. This isn&rsquo;t just a typical war movie, We don&rsquo;t see a glorification of war. In fact what was so different about this film was that these two soldiers who were supposed to be fighting in the war are actually working together to prevent it from happening. This is very different from the traditional military movie where the main characters are shown to be invincible and landing every shot. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">1917 touches upon many different Ideas but the main ideas shown in this film are loss, bravery and warfare. This film would would be be categorized as an anti war film due to the normal and non- glofied view of battle<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
